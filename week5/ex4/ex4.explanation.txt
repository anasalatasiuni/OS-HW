this is the result of the script when run on my pc.
$ ./ex4.sh 
time when m = 1:
real    0m5.423s
user    0m5.422s
sys     0m0.000s
time when m = 2:
real    0m2.850s
user    0m5.615s
sys     0m0.084s
time when m = 4:
real    0m2.256s
user    0m8.441s
sys     0m0.572s
time when m = 10:
real    0m2.435s
user    0m15.483s
sys     0m3.469s
time when m = 100:
real    0m2.773s
user    0m18.724s
sys     0m3.137s

it is notable that the execution time goes down when the number of threads increases as more threads are involved
in the processing. But when the number of threads is more than the real number of threads of the cpu the performance
will not improve the performance. Instead it will waste time on creating and scheduling the threads. Also we notice 
that ex3 is faster ex4 because locking mutex variables decrease performance.
