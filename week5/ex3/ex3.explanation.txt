this is the result of the script when run on my pc.
$ ./ex3.sh 
time when m = 1:
real    0m5.267s
user    0m5.267s
sys     0m0.000s
time when m = 2:
real    0m3.295s
user    0m5.281s
sys     0m0.000s
time when m = 4:
real    0m1.785s
user    0m5.666s
sys     0m0.004s
time when m = 10:
real    0m1.337s
user    0m8.572s
sys     0m0.004s
time when m = 100:
real    0m2.079s
user    0m16.295s
sys     0m0.008s

it is notable that the execution time goes down when the number of threads increases as more threads are involved
in the processing. But when the number of threads is more than the real number of threads of the cpu the performance
will not improve the performance. Instead it will waste time on creating and scheduling the threads.
