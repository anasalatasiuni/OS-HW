16 bit virtual addresses -> [0...65535] numbered addresses
Each page is 8KB = 8192 bytes

16 bits of virtual addresses is enough to address up to 8 pages of 8KB each,
as all [0...65535] addresses will align with 8 * 8192 possible byte-sized pieces
of memory.

Hence, the page table will have 8 entries - one for each page, containing a virtual
and physical address.
