Physical address is the address in the physical memory, For example in your RAM, calculated with respect to the start of the memory.

For example, if the atomic page in memory is 4KB, and the whole memory is of the size 32KB,
there can be 8 pages in memory, each having an address from 0 to 7.

On the other hand, virtual address is the address of the same page in memory, but calculated from the
beginning of the virtual memory.

For example, when a program is partially loaded in physical memory, a page can have one physical
address, and a different virtual address. The first one will depict the address of a page currently
used in RAM, the other one will depict the address in virtual memory, which is usually emulated on the diskspace.
